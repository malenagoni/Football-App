# Football-App

I worked on this project to practice React-Redux for my exam at Henry bootcamp! It was my first time using both technologies and I was amazed by the things I could do with them!! I used some guidance with Youtube videos. Specially from Edteam âš½

I used HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, ReactJS and ReduxJS.

## And of course you can delete to edit or to restart the selection!!
